##WEB DEVELOPMENT & DESIGN (by Anna Mast)
####As the curator and creator of "100 DAYS OF ART," Anna Mastoridou sought not only to celebrate the rich tapestry of human creativity but also to ignite a spark of curiosity and wonder in all who encountered it. For art is not merely confined to museums and galleries; it is a living, breathing force that permeates every aspect of our lives, enriching our experiences and challenging our perceptions.
